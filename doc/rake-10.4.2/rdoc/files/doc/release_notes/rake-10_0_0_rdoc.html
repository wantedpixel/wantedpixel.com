      <h1><a href="../../../classes/Rake.html">Rake</a> 10.0 Released</h1>
<pre>
  &quot;Jim, when will Rake reach version 1.0?&quot;
</pre>
<p>
Over the past several years I&#8216;ve been asked that question at
conferences, panels and over twitter. Due to historical reasons (or maybe
just plain laziness) <a href="../../../classes/Rake.html">Rake</a> has
(incorrectly) been treating the second digit of the version as the major
release number. So in my head <a href="../../../classes/Rake.html">Rake</a>
was already at version 9.
</p>
<p>
Well, it&#8216;s time to fix things. This next version of <a
href="../../../classes/Rake.html">Rake</a> drops old, crufty, backwards
compatibility hacks such as top level constants, DSL methods defined in
Object and numerous other features that are just no longer desired.
It&#8216;s also time to drop the leading zero from the version number as
well and call this new version of rake what it really is: Version 10.
</p>
<p>
So, welcome to <a href="../../../classes/Rake.html">Rake</a> 10.0!
</p>
<p>
<a href="../../../classes/Rake.html">Rake</a> 10 is actually feature
identical to the latest version of <a
href="../../../classes/Rake.html">Rake</a> 9 (that would be the version
spelled 0.9.3), <b>except</b> that <a
href="../../../classes/Rake.html">Rake</a> 10 drops all the sundry
deprecated features that have accumulated over the years.
</p>
<p>
If your Rakefile is up to date and current with all the new features of <a
href="../../../classes/Rake.html">Rake</a> 10, you are ready to go. If your
Rakefile still uses a few deprecated feeatures, feel free to use <a
href="../../../classes/Rake.html">Rake</a> 9 (0.9.3) with the same feature
set. Just be aware that future features will be in <a
href="../../../classes/Rake.html">Rake</a> 10 family line.
</p>
<h2>Changes in 10.0</h2>
<p>
As mentioned above, there are no new features in <a
href="../../../classes/Rake.html">Rake</a> 10. However, there are a number
of features missing:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Classic namespaces are now gone. <a
href="../../../classes/Rake.html">Rake</a> is no longer able to reflect the
options settings in the global variables ($rakefile, $show_tasks,
$show_prereqs, $trace, $dryrun and $silent). The
<tt>&#8212;classic-namespace</tt> option is no longer supported.

</li>
<li>Global constants are no longer supported. This includes <tt>Task</tt>,
<tt>FileTask</tt>, <tt>FileCreationTask</tt> and <tt>RakeApp</tt>). The
constant missing hook to warn about using global rake constants has been
removed.

</li>
<li>The <a href="../../../classes/Rake.html">Rake</a> DSL methods (task, file,
directory, etc) are in their own module (<a
href="../../../classes/Rake/DSL.html">Rake::DSL</a>). The stub versions of
these methods (that printed warnings) in Object have been removed. However,
the DSL methods are added to the top-level <tt>main</tt> object. Since
<tt>main</tt> is not in the inheritance tree, the presence of the DSL
methods in main should be low impact on other libraries.

<p>
If you want to use the <a href="../../../classes/Rake.html">Rake</a> DSL
commands from your own code, just include <tt><a
href="../../../classes/Rake/DSL.html">Rake::DSL</a></tt> into your own
classes and modules.
</p>
</li>
<li>The deprecated syntax for task arguments (the one using <tt>:needs</tt>)
has been removed.

</li>
<li>The <tt>&#8212;reduce-compat</tt> flag has been removed (it&#8216;s not
needed anymore).

</li>
<li>The deprecated <tt>rake/sys.rb</tt> library has been removed.

</li>
<li>The deprecated <tt>rake/rdoctask.rb</tt> library has been removed. RDoc
supplies its own rake task now.

</li>
<li>The deprecated <tt>rake/gempackagetask.rb</tt> library has been removed.
Gem supplies its own package task now.

</li>
</ul>
<p>
There is one small behavioral change:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Non-file tasks now always report the current time as their time stamp. This
is different from the previous behavior where non-file tasks reported
current time only if there were no prerequisites, and the max prerequisite
timestamp otherwise. This lead to inconsistent and surprising behavior when
adding prerequisites to tasks that in turn were prequisites to file tasks.
The new behavior is more consistent and predictable.

</li>
</ul>
<h2>Changes (from 0.9.3)</h2>
<p>
Since <a href="../../../classes/Rake.html">Rake</a> 10 includes the changes
from the last version of <a href="../../../classes/Rake.html">Rake</a> 9,
we&#8216;ll repeat the changes for version 0.9.3 here.
</p>
<h3>New Features</h3>
<ul>
<li>Multitask tasks now use a thread pool. Use -j to limit the number of
available threads.

</li>
<li>Use -m to turn regular tasks into multitasks (use at your own risk).

</li>
<li>You can now do &quot;<a
href="../../../classes/Rake.html#M000275">Rake.add_rakelib</a>
&#8216;dir&#8217;&quot; in your Rakefile to programatically add rake task
libraries.

</li>
<li>You can specific backtrace suppression patterns (see
&#8212;supress-backtrace)

</li>
<li>Directory tasks can now take prerequisites and actions

</li>
<li>Use &#8212;backtrace to request a full backtrace without the task trace.

</li>
<li>You can say &quot;&#8212;backtrace=stdout&quot; and
&quot;&#8212;trace=stdout&quot; to route trace output to standard output
rather than standard error.

</li>
<li>Optional &#8216;phony&#8217; target (enable with &#8216;require
&#8216;rake/phony&#8217;&quot;) for special purpose builds.

</li>
<li>Task#clear now clears task comments as well as actions and prerequisites.
Task#clear_comment will specifically target comments.

</li>
<li>The &#8212;all option will force -T and -D to consider all the tasks, with
and without descriptions.

</li>
</ul>
<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>
<ul>
<li>Semi-colons in windows rakefile paths now work.

</li>
<li>Improved Control-C support when invoking multiple test suites.

</li>
<li>egrep method now reads files in text mode (better support for Windows)

</li>
<li>Better deprecation line number reporting.

</li>
<li>The -W option now works with all tasks, whether they have a description or
not.

</li>
<li>File globs in rake should not be sorted alphabetically, independent of file
system and platform.

</li>
<li>Numerous internal improvements.

</li>
<li>Documentation typos and fixes.

</li>
</ul>
<h2>What is <a href="../../../classes/Rake.html">Rake</a></h2>
<p>
<a href="../../../classes/Rake.html">Rake</a> is a build tool similar to
the make program in many ways. But instead of cryptic make recipes, <a
href="../../../classes/Rake.html">Rake</a> uses standard Ruby code to
declare tasks and dependencies. You have the full power of a modern
scripting language built right into your build tool.
</p>
<h2>Availability</h2>
<p>
The easiest way to get and install rake is via RubyGems &#8230;
</p>
<pre>
  gem install rake    (you may need root/admin privileges)
</pre>
<p>
Otherwise, you can get it from the more traditional places:
