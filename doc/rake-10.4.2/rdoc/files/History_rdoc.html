unit tests.

bug). Added many tests around file list.

</li>
<li>Added <tt>ext</tt> method to both <a

recursion. Since to_a was removed from Object, it does not need to added

</li>

built-in test task macros because the rake runtime is no longer needed.

</li>

Test Task macros.

flexibility in specifying test files.

<ul>
<li>FileList now uses deferred loading. The file system is not searched until
the first call that needs the file names.

</li>
<li>VAR=VALUE options are now accepted on the command line and are treated like
environment variables. The values may be tested in a Rakefile by
referencing ENV[&#8216;VAR&#8217;].

</li>
</ul>
<h3>0.3.2.x</h3>

if they are installed.
