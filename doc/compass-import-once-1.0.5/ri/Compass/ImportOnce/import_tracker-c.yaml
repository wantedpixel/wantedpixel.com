- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: A map of css filenames to a set of engine cache keys that uniquely identify what has been imported. The lifecycle of each key is handled by code wrapped around Sass's render, to_css and render_with_sourcemap methods on the Sass::Engine.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: Ideally, Sass would provide a place in it's public API to put information that persists for only the duration of a single compile and would be accessible for all sass engines and sass functions written in ruby.
