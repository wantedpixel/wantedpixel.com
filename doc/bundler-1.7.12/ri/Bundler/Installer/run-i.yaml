- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: Runs the install procedures for a specific Gemfile.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: Firstly, this method will check to see if Bundler.bundle_path exists and if not then will create it. This is usually the location of gems on the system, be it RVM or at a system path.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: Secondly, it checks if Bundler has been configured to be &quot;frozen&quot; Frozen ensures that the Gemfile and the Gemfile.lock file are matching. This stops a situation where a developer may update the Gemfile but may not run `bundle install`, which leads to the Gemfile.lock file not being correctly updated. If this file is not correctly updated then any other developer running `bundle install` will potentially not install the correct gems.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: Thirdly, Bundler checks if there are any dependencies specified in the Gemfile using Bundler::Environment#dependencies. If there are no dependencies specified then Bundler returns a warning message stating so and this method returns.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: Fourthly, Bundler checks if the default lockfile (Gemfile.lock) exists, and if so then proceeds to set up a defintion based on the default gemfile (Gemfile) and the default lock file (Gemfile.lock). However, this is not the case if the platform is different to that which is specified in Gemfile.lock, or if there are any missing specs for the gems.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: Fifthly, Bundler resolves the dependencies either through a cache of gems or by remote. This then leads into the gems being installed, along with stubs for their executables, but only if the --binstubs option has been passed or Bundler.options[:bin] has been set earlier.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: Sixthly, a new Gemfile.lock is created from the installed gems to ensure that the next time that a user runs `bundle install` they will receive any updates from this process.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: "Finally: TODO add documentation for how the standalone process works."
