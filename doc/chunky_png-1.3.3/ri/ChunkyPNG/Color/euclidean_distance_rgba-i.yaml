- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: Compute the Euclidean distance between 2 colors in RGBA
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: This method simply takes the Euclidean distance between the RGBA channels of 2 colors, which gives us a measure of how different the two colors are.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: Although it would be more perceptually accurate to calculate a proper Delta E in Lab colorspace, this method should serve many use-cases while avoiding the overhead of converting RGBA to Lab.
