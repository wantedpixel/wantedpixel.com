- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: Returns a Ruby IO object wrapping the underlying file descriptor. Since this file descriptor is fully functional (except under JRuby), this IO object can be used in any way a Ruby-created IO object can. This includes passing it to functions like `#select`.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: Note that this always returns the same IO object. Creating lots of IO objects for the same file descriptor can cause some odd problems.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: "**This is not supported under JRuby**. JRuby currently doesn't use native file descriptors for the IO object, so we can't use this file descriptor as a stand-in."
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: "@return [IO] An IO object wrapping the file descriptor @raise [NotImplementedError] if this is being called in JRuby"
