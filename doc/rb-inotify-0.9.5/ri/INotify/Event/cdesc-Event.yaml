    body: An integer specifying that this event is related to some other event, which will have the same cookie.
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
    body: Currently, this is only used for files that are moved within the same directory. Both the `:moved_from` and the `:moved_to` events will have the same cookie.

  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
    body: The name of the file that the event occurred on. This is only set for events that occur on files in directories; otherwise, it's `&quot;&quot;`. Similarly, if the event is being fired for the directory itself the name will be `&quot;&quot;`
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
    body: This pathname is relative to the enclosing directory. For the absolute pathname, use \{#absolute_name}. Note that when the `:recursive` flag is passed to {Notifier#watch}, events in nested subdirectories will still have a `#name` field relative to their immediately enclosing directory. For example, an event on the file `&quot;foo/bar/baz&quot;` will have name `&quot;baz&quot;`.
